# Fixing Pop Sound in Linux Audio  

To eliminate popping sounds in your audio, follow these steps:  

First, test if disabling power saving resolves the issue:  

```bash
sudo nano /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save

Change its value from 1 to 0.

sudo nano /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save_controller

Change Y to N.

If the distortions (noise, buzzing, crackling, etc.) are gone, make the changes permanent:

cd /etc/modprobe.d
sudo nano audio_disable_powersave.conf

Add the following line:

options snd_hda_intel power_save=0

Save the file and exit, then apply the changes by rebooting your system:

sudo reboot
